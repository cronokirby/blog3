This is a review of [The New York Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Trilogy) written by [Paul Auster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Auster) in 1987.

As the title says, this book is actually a trilogy of three shorter novels: *City of Glass*,
*Ghosts*, and *The Locked Room*.

Without spoiling the novel, I will say that it should really be taken as a whole, instead of as three
separate books that happen to share themes. At the start of the book it may not be obvious why
I think this way, but by the end I think you'll come to see what I'm getting at.

Each novel is structured a bit like a detective novel, with the protagonists tasked with trailing
or discovering some person each time. I'll get to the contents of each novel later though.

Paul Auster's writing is very fluid, and he does an excellent job of describing how the story
*feels* to each protagonist. When describing a scene, Auster focuses mainly on the protagonists
perception of it, rather than feeding us the details straight. The focus of the book is inherently
central to each protagonist, each story definitely skewed to their "version" of events.
Even though the book is mainly description, it does a good job of
keeping you interesting, never overstaying a particular scene. Each novel flows nicely between the
events keeping you on your toes with new developments and interesting premises.

That being said, the book does feel like it repeats itself a bit, but that also seems to be the point
of the book, in some sense. I think Auster sought to write three novels about the same things, and
that's the appeal of the trilogy as a whole.

## Common Themes

The recurring themes throughout the book / novels include *paranoia*, *impersonation*,
and *self-referentiality*.

Throughout the book, the protagonists experience progressively mounting paranoia, as they get
more and more obsessed with their task, and wary of their surroundings. This is a common theme for
detective novels, but the degree to which the protagonists fall into this trap is elevated.

Another persistent theme in all 3 novels is how each protagonist has to play the role of another person.
This happens because one of the protagonists is a writer, so he impersonates and takes on the mannerisms
of his main character, but also because the protagonists act as detectives, and so have to conceal
their own identity.

The book also references itself and its author. In the first novel, the main character impersonates
a detectived named "Paul Auster", after the author himself. The book also references its own novels
directly and indirectly.

# Synopsis: City of Glass

City of Glass starts with our protagonist, Quinn. Quinn is a writer in New York City, who has gone
from being an accomplished writer to churning out pulp detective novels under a fake name. The
main character in his detective novels goes by "Max Work", and Quinn's work as a writer involves
imagining himself as Work.

One day, he starts getting distressed phone calls from a woman asking for a detective "Paul Auster".
At first he ignores the calls, as he is not Paul Auster, but eventually he pretends to be that
detective and goes to visit the woman.

The woman explains to him that her husband's father is getting out of prison soon, and that she'd like
Paul (as she knows him) to keep an eye on the man to make sure no harm comes to her husband. Her husband,
Peter Stillman, was locked in a room as a child by his father. His father was trying to discover
the language men spoke in the garden of eden, a language in which everything you say perfectly
describes what you're thinking of. The father thought that by keeping his son locked in his room,
he would eventually digress down to speaking that original language, untainted by the influence of
modern language.

At some point, their house had a fire, and Peter Stillman Jr., the son, was discovered, and Peter
Stillman Sr., the father was emprisoned for what he had put his son through.

Quinn, taking upon the alias of Paul Auster, starts trailing the father, and doesn't end up discovering
much. In order to interact with the father without blowing his cover, he takes on various disguises.
He pretends to be a homeless begger, asking for change. Then he pretends to be himself, and goes up
to the father directly. Of course, since he's supposed to be Paul Auster, the detective, going
up as Quinn, the writer, is not actually revealing his identity. He takes on a third monicker,
"Henry Dark", to which the father responds by telling him that it's not "his true name". As if
he can tell what someone's true name is or isn't.

At some point, he ends up visiting the real Paul Auster, who he thinks is actually a detective,
whose number somehow got mixed up with his at the beginning of the affair. It turns out that Paul Auster
is actually just a writer. In fact, the Paul Auster depicted in this novel is essentially the
same Paul Auster that wrote this book.

Eventually Quinn loses contact with his client, who has holed herself up, along with her husband, inside of their appartment.
He decides to keep watch on the building 24/7, barely going out to eat, and trying to sleep
in minute long naps to not lose sight of the appartment. He becomes more and more paranoid, and more
and more roughed up from living on the street. Eventually, he decides to break into the appartment,
which he finds empty.

Inside the appartment, he confines himself to a dark room, with nothing but his red notebook, which
he used to keep track of the case previously. This is the same room where Peter Stillman Jr. had
previously taken the habit of isolating himself from his wife and other people. Someone brings him
food every day, and eventually he runs out of pages to write in. We don't know who was bringing
him food, or why. We also don't know where he went at the end of the book.

The book ends with the narrator telling us of his discovery of the empty appartment, and the notebook.
It's implied that the contents of the notebook were used to write the novel itself. In some
sense, the novel was written by its own protagonist.

# Synopsis: Ghosts

In this novel, the protagonist, Blue, is tasked with following a man named Black, by his client, White.

He follows Black around everyday, writing down everything he sees. He notices that Black spends
most of the day writing in his study. His contact with his client is minimal, but when he tries
to catch his client putting his monthly cheque in his mailbox, he sees a masked man doing
the same. He then gets a mysterious message from his client telling him that he does not like
being watched.

Eventually, Blue starts to get the suspicion that there's no purpose to his tracking Black, and
this is all an elaborate plot to mess with his head. He learns that Black has also been tasked with
following him. Black has been writing in his own book everyday about what Blue has been doing.

At the end of the novel comes an almost inevitable confrontation between the two detectives.
At this end, Black threatens Blue, and they both realize that they're the same person.

The ending is confusing, but upends the entire novel. We realize that nothing in the novel really
happened, that it's all a metaphore for a man grappling with his own identity.
